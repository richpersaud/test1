Released as Open-Source Software (OSS) in [June 2014](http://www.slideshare.net/xen_com_mgr/tricca-xen-summit2014), OpenXT stands on the shoulders of [Xen Project](http://xen.org) and [OpenEmbedded](http://openembedded.org).  It is derived from XenClient XT, which was first released in [May 2011](http://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/may-2011/citrix-announces-xenclient-2-and-xenclient-xt.html).

OpenXT is being developed to meet the varied needs of the security and virtualization communities, as an interoperability toolkit for the configurable [disaggregation](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation) of operating systems and user workflows.  

Project goals include:

+ De-duplication of hardware testing & optimization
+ Technical documentation for appliance developers
+ Interoperability of platform and guest appliances

# What can you do with OpenXT?

+ **_Researcher?_** &nbsp; With the performance of a bare-metal hypervisor, the customizability of an open platform, the freedom of Linux scientific computing, the productivity of a Windows desktop, protection of research data and isolation of experimental workloads &mdash; OpenXT appliances can accelerate and protect innovations.
<br>
<br>
+ **_OEM?_** &nbsp; Each device's OpenXT validation cycle can support multiple versions of multiple operating systems and applications, growing each device's <a href="http://www.softwareecosystems.org/">ecosystem</a>.  Innovative hardware can be integrated once to support platform appliances for multiple vertical markets. Premium, virtualization-optimized hardware can help users maximize business value from integrated appliances.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Integrator?_** &nbsp; Developing an operating system requires <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/sites/main/files/publications/estimatinglinux.html">expensive skills</a> to keep pace with both hardware innovation cycles and vertical market requirements.  As a royalty-free interoperability toolkit, OpenXT can maximize compatibility between hardware and specialty workloads, improving time-to-market and functionality of custom appliances.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Enterprise IT?_** &nbsp; OS upgrades can be decoupled from hardware upgrades. Transitions can be timed for business benefits from new hardware and software, without disrupting legacy workflows.  OpenXT virtualization can increase choice in concurrent workloads, reduce infrastructure costs, and isolate operational risks of new applications and network services.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Buyer?_** &nbsp; OpenXT appliances can integrate off-the-shelf (COTS) software with the usability and compliance of a tailored solution, including hardware-assisted isolation and policy management of workloads. This increases business flexibility, as interoperable OpenXT investments can be resilient to changes in supply chains, security threat models and business leadership priorities.
