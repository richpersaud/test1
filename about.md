Released as Open-Source Software (OSS) in [June 2014](http://www.slideshare.net/xen_com_mgr/tricca-xen-summit2014), OpenXT stands on the shoulders of [Xen Project](http://xen.org) and [OpenEmbedded](http://openembedded.org).  It is derived from XenClient XT, which was first released in [May 2011](http://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/may-2011/citrix-announces-xenclient-2-and-xenclient-xt.html).

OpenXT is being developed to meet the varied needs of the security and virtualization communities, as an interoperability toolkit for the configurable [disaggregation](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation) of operating systems and user workflows.  

Project goals include:

+ De-duplication of hardware testing & optimization
+ Technical documentation for appliance developers
+ Interoperability of platform and guest appliances

# What can you do with OpenXT?

+ **_Researcher?_** &nbsp; With the performance of a bare-metal hypervisor, the customizability of an open platform, the freedom of Linux scientific computing, the productivity of a Windows desktop, protection of research data and isolation of experimental workloads &mdash; OpenXT appliances can accelerate and protect innovations.
<br>
<br>
+ **_OEM?_** &nbsp; Each device's OpenXT validation cycle can support multiple versions of multiple operating systems and apps, growing the <a href="http://www.softwareecosystems.org/">ecosystem</a> of device developers.  Innovative hardware can be integrated once to support platform appliances for multiple vertical markets. Premium, virtualization-optimized devices can help users maximize business value from diverse workloads.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Integrator?_** &nbsp; Developing an operating system requires <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/sites/main/files/publications/estimatinglinux.html">expensive skills</a> to keep pace with both hardware innovation cycles and vertical market requirements.  As a royalty-free interoperability toolkit, OpenXT can maximize compatibility between hardware and specialty workloads, improving time-to-market and breadth of functionality for custom vertical solutions.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Enterprise IT?_** &nbsp; OS upgrades can be decoupled from hardware upgrades. Transitions can be timed for business benefits from new hardware and software, without disrupting legacy workflows.  Virtualization increases choice in concurrent workloads, reduces infrastructure costs and isolates the operational risks of new applications and network services.
<br>
<br>
+ **_Buyer?_** &nbsp; OpenXT appliances can combine off-the-shelf software economics with the usability and compliance of a tailored vertical solution, thanks to hardware-assisted isolation and policy management of vendor workloads. This increases business flexibility, as interoperable OpenXT investments can be reconfigured in response to user, departmental, regional or M&A changes.
