OpenXT is an open-source interoperability toolkit for hardware-assisted security research and appliance integration. It includes hardened <a href="http://www.xenproject.org">Xen</a> VMs that can be configured as a bare-metal virtualization appliance, for client devices with concurrent Linux and/or Windows guests.
<br>
<br>
It has been used to develop managed software appliances that isolate demanding graphics workloads, untrusted workloads and multiple networks on a single laptop or desktop.
OpenXT is optimized for x86 devices with Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-virtualization-technology-for-directed-io-vt-d-enhancing-intel-platforms-for-efficient-virtualization-of-io-devices">VT-d</a>, <a href="https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/intel_txt.txt">TXT</a> (Trusted Execution Technology) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</a>.
<br>
<br>
Client appliances developed with OpenXT can contain a mixture of open-source and proprietary software, supporting a range of business models. OEMs, integrators and customers can customize managed OpenXT appliances, combining the integrity of vertical solutions with the business flexibility of general-purpose computing.

<h2>Ecosystem Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Researcher:</i></b> &nbsp; With the performance of a bare-metal hypervisor, the freedom of Linux scientific computing, the productivity of a Windows desktop, protection of high-value data and strong isolation of experimental workloads &mdash; OpenXT appliances can unlock innovation.
<br>
<br>
<li><i><b>OEM:</b></i> &nbsp; Each device's OpenXT validation cycle can support multiple versions of multiple operating systems and apps, growing the <a href="http://www.softwareecosystems.org/">ecosystem</a> of device developers.  Innovative hardware is integrated once to support platform appliances for multiple vertical markets. Premium, virtualization-optimized devices can help users maximize business value from diverse workloads.
<br>
<br>
<li><i><b>Integrator:</i></b> &nbsp; Developing an operating system requires <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/sites/main/files/publications/estimatinglinux.html">expensive skills</a> to keep pace with both hardware innovation cycles and vertical market requirements.  As a royalty-free interoperability toolkit, OpenXT can maximize hardware and workload compatibility, improving time-to-market and breadth of functionality for custom vertical solutions.
<br>
<br>
<li><i><b>Enterprise IT:</i></b> &nbsp; OS upgrades can be decoupled from hardware upgrades. Transitions can be timed for business benefit from new hardware and software, without disrupting legacy workflows.  Virtualization increases choice in workloads, reduces cost and isolates the operational risk of new applications and network services.
<br>
<br>
<li><i><b>Buyer:</i></b> &nbsp; OpenXT appliances can combine off-the-shelf software economics with the usability and compliance of a tailored vertical solution, thanks to hardware-assisted isolation and policy management of vendor workloads. This increases business flexibility, as interoperable OpenXT investments can be reconfigured in response to user, departmental, regional or M&A changes.
